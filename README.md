    <i>Current video conferencing tools like Zoom can take an input feed (left) and replace the background, often introducing artifacts, as shown in the center result with close-ups of hair and glasses that still have the residual of the original background. Leveraging a frame of video without the subject (far left inset), our method produces real-time, high-resolution background matting without those common artifacts. The image on the right is our result with the corresponding close-ups, screenshot from our Zoom plugin implementation.</i>
